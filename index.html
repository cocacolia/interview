<p class="intro">The news of Stefan Fraunberger’s performance at the Bouquet Kyiv Stage festival in the courtyard of Saint Sophia Cathedral at the end of summer surprised me a lot. It was possible to hope that a full-fledged touring life would resume this year, except without hope. And it seemed all the more incredible to meet at home the artist, whom I have been following with interest for several years.

Stefan Fraunberger is an electroacoustic composer and musician from Vienna. He also has qualifications in the fields of European philosophy, Arabic, and Oriental studies. Interests and circumstances prompted Stefan to travel–he managed to live and work in Belgium, Romania, a number of Middle Eastern countries, and India.

His main musical instrument is the hammered dulcimer. In its regional variations, it creates a certain cultural continuum–from the Austrian Alps to South Asia, and further in all directions. Mostly, Fraunberger performs with the Persian version of the hammered dulcimer–the santur. Using effects pedals and amplification, he explores the new sound capabilities of this ancestor of the piano. His purpose is to create a kind of synthesizer from an ancient instrument, a loud "spaceship".

Another striking example of such sonic archeology is Fraunberger's long-running project Quellegeister, which can be roughly translated as "source-spirits." In it, he explores the abandoned Baroque organs in the desert Saxon and Landler churches of Transylvania. The composer's interest is chained to the influence of the non-human on man-made things. The sound of the damaged instruments can evoke ghostly associations in the listener. I can add that the last record in this series is one of the few ones that caused a reaction in my cat.

Stefan used to theoretically substantiate his artistic practice. We found shelter from the drizzle under a tree in the famous courtyard with ravens on Reitarska Street. My goal was trying to explain the philosophy of Fraunberger’s language of things in a simple way.</p>

    <div class="question">
Does it somehow define you, to always be in between the contexts?</div>
<div class="answer">
    Yes, I can definitely say so. To always be in between the contexts is something that cannot be defined. There’s a word in Arabic, al bayan, which in fact means “in-between”. So I could say it’s the “bayan”. The in-between, which is the definition of things not being this or that. 
<br>
    But still “bayan” is translated with “defined”. The limit between the two objectivities defines both of them. So the limit is the definition, not the object. If there is no limitation, then there is no existence, no world.
<br>
    For me, it seems important to create contexts, not to work with existing ones. That's the way things go: relations define objects. I think the movement of limitations is defining us and our perception of things.
</div>
    
<div class="question">
    From what I know about you and your music, I can say that you rather play in the genre of your own than stick to the conventions.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
    As it is said: the demand defines the offer. In some fields of the “holy market”, this might even hold true: if people want to buy cars, then demand defines what they will be offered. Grrr… The effects of this process–desires and demands are creating a certain reality–seem to be catastrophic for the world. I would call it the terror of the situation. In art, it’s a tragedy if this happens. Unfortunately, it mostly happens like that. So the demands of the audience or the “consumer” would finally define the aesthetics of what is “produced”. From my point of view, we need to completely change our worldview from production to creation. I think Nietzsche made this clear in “The Birth of the Tragedy”. If music is a product, if it is produced for the audience, the product will be consumed and over out: ready for the trash bin. Instead, we should create because we want to. That's a high responsibility.
    </div>
<div class="question">
    You’re the first time in Kyiv. How did you like to interact with the audience and the local context? What did you want them to recall or to relate to?.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
    I feel fine with the language of things. In case a relation is created, I try to put it in the limits of the language of things. A part of this language I developed for this instrument, the hammered dulcimer, the santur. It relates to me, so I relate it to others. First of all, I liked its sound as it is used in different traditions. That’s why I got into it but never learned the traditions in detail. In contrast to some of my other works, I do tune it. Also yesterday I tuned it to a certain mode, the dastgāh–the Persian mode Šur. Which is different than those we normally have. Still, I’m not relating to the Persian tradition, cause they play a completely different style, and the tuning system could be Indian or Rebetiko (Greek) as well.
<br>
<br>
So my intention is to develop some kind of language, being related to amplification. My aim is to create certain limitations. If the hammered dulcimer or the santur is amplified, you have a wholly different sound. You just have the electromagnetic vibrations of the strings. And with this, you can do different things. Whatever you want! So it’s not just the instrument and the strings. It’s also the loudspeakers speaking. And again it’s in between, to play the instrument. Don’t just let the computer do it or have fancy tools and products, let ‘em roll and feel like a hero. OK [laughs]. And you think you’re playing live! It’s interesting, performing live with an instrument without falling into dogmas of how to do things and how not to do things.

Finally, a lot of my work is creating new instruments, being based on relating wholly different technical, cultural, and ontological approaches.

<div class="question">
    You are a critic of the term ‘’cultural appropriation’’.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
    If you take the term ‘’cultural appropriation’’ in its initial sense coming from ethnology, coming from postcolonial studies, it just means “don’t steal something that you’re not in relation to’’. But If you know about the culture, if you have a relation to it, that’s not called cultural appropriation by definition.
<br>
<br>
As always things got perverted and people, not having the necessary education, not knowing too much about postcolonial studies, would think anything outside of universal Western culture is cultural. And if you intervene with it, then it’s cultural appropriation. This is again some kind of colonialism. Because you take the colonial culture as universal and everything else is being protected like this raven in the cage [points at the raven literally]. Culture being protected like in the zoo. And mostly it’s also not so real, cause anyhow the whole world is covered with the same European cosmology till now. The notion of different cultures is slightly nostalgic. There are different languages, and people having different habits, but not in the sense of the 19th century. Then the human world consisted of completely different cultures. But through globalisation, the world was missionised with a certain kind of technology. The whole naturalistic Euro-religion of Enlightenment was flattening the world. Isn’t it an irony that those that missionised the planet with the knowledge of the world being round finally made it flat?
